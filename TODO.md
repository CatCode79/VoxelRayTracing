- Make world infinite
- Improve performance
- Allow user to enable simpler shader for low-end hardware
- Make player appear in reflections
- Add textures
- Actually use `max_ray_steps` in the raytracer
- Add distance fog or LOD
- remove weird visual artifacts created by the raytracer
- world saving / loading (maybe loading MC worlds)
- Improve memory footprint of world
- Have breaking/placing blocks not ensue re-uploading the entire world to the GPU
- Implement denoiser
